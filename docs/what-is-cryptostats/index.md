# What is CryptoStats?

The goal of CryptoStats is embodied by the project’s motto: to become “One neutral source of truth for crypto metrics. Used by everyone, owned by the community.”

CryptoStats aims to become the schelling point for all data metrics in the DeFi and wider crypto ecosystem. Furthermore, it aims to host all important and relevant crypto metrics, and be a crucial part of the stack for all websites and applications that depend on reliable data metrics.
